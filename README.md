# NLP-Disaster-Tweets-Kaggle-Mini-Project
This project uses data from the Kaggle competition “Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets.” The goal is to build a simple machine learning model that predicts whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0).

# Conclusion :
This project used Kaggle’s Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets dataset to predict whether a tweet describes a real disaster.
I trained a simple TF-IDF + Logistic Regression model, reaching an F1 score of about 0.70.
The model worked well for short messages and hashtags.
In the future, I would try using a small transformer model such as BERT to improve accuracy.
